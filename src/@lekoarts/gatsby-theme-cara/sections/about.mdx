The English language can't quite keep up with the wild carnival of thoughts inside my noggin. That's why I've decided to sprinkle some emoji magic into my speech, just to give my brain waves a little extra pizzazz. 😜

You ever get that warm, fuzzy feeling when you see two otters clasping hands like they're at an otter disco? Well, get ready to feel like that every single day, my friend. My mom shed a tear the day I made my entrance into this world, 'cause she knew she'd never outshine my fabulousness. So, if you're looking for a campaign manager, look no further!🎩🤥
